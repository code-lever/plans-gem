# Overview
<!-- A brief description of the feature -->

# User Stories
<!-- Repeat the following for each user story. -->

## User Story
<!--
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.
-->

### Scenarios
<!-- Write out scenarios using Gherkin syntax.

https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin

Use Given to establish preconditions for the scenario.
Use When to describe the key actions preformed by the user.
Use Then to observe outcomes. In general, these will be responses form the System 

Here is an example:

Given some precondition
And some other precondition
When some action by the user type 
And some other action
And yet another action
Then some testable outcome is achieved
And something else we can check happens too

Make the user one of the user types defined in the User Classes document.
-->

### Mockups
<!-- Show each of the mockups used by the scenarios here.
Add any additional detail about the mockup below it. For example, important validations or data types for fields.
 -->

### Confirmations
<!-- Something the system must do that needs to have a test. A requirement that is important to the customer and must be verified. These can also be non-fuctional requirements related to the feature.

Ex: Test different privacy status - private, public, unlisted.
